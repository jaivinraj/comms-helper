## 1. What is this for?

This app aims to give a flavour of what's going on in the Twittersphere around a particular issue or topic.


## 2. How to use this repo ‚ùì

1. Install Docker [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (if you don't already have it) 
2. In the terminal, run `docker-compose up -d` (Note: if a new version has been released, you may need to rebuild the image. This can be done using `docker-compose build --no-cache`)
3. Once the container has built (you can check using `docker ps`), bash into it using `docker exec -it comms-helper /bin/bash`
4. Inside the container, run the dashboard using `python src/comms_helper/dashboard/main.py`
5. Follow the link to http://0.0.0.0:8050/ and you can access the dashboard
